# Case Study Responses

## Case Study 1

#### It's Week 2 and you've noticed one of your students, Tom Jerry, is very disengaged. Tom has not been attending guided projects and has been skipping stand-ups, and when they do attend, they have their camera off or are clearly demonstrating they aren't paying attention. 

To start, I would be sure that I am appraising Tom's current performance accurately with the tools at my disposal (sprint reviews, attendance tracking, etc.) I would DM Tom, and ask him how things are going.  I would also point the observed concerns, and ask if he would like to Zoom with me to discuss further.  I would approach the meeting mainly as a listener, and then ask if there was any way I could help.

If that offer was refused, I would be sure to restate the expectations of him as a student, and tell him that without explanations on his part, I would have no choice but to escalate to the Section Lead or Student Success.

If I was successful, Tom would be able to find a workable solution to his problem, be it flexing or taking a short hiatus to get things right.

#### Part 2: Another student in your group comes to you and says Tom's behavior in stand-up is making them feel uncomfortable talking through their project.

First, I would ask the student about the specific behavior that is making them uncomfortable, and if it's not something that could be worked out between us, I would contact Tom separately and address the situation with him.  If the behavior persists, I would alert Tom that I will be escalating the situation to the SL / Student Success.

## Case Study 2

#### You've noticed one of your students, Draco Malfoy, consistently tries to take over the group. They are disruptive in Slack and in stand-ups. They are consistently showing off, cutting other people off from talking, and they are very hard for others to work with in a group. Multiple students have reached out to you to say they are upset by Draco's behavior.

I would attempt to address the situation first in the meeting, by asking Draco to please give others a chance to be heard.  If the behavior persists, I would have a one-on-one zoom meeting with him, and try to dig deeper into the issue at hand.  I would point out how his behavior makes others feel, and let him know that to continue in this manner is unacceptable, and remind him of the expectations placed on him as a student and future professional.  I would use specific policies listed in the handbookg as examples, if applicable.

If the situation could not be handled by me personally, I would obviously start the escalation process by notifying the SL.

## Case Study 3

#### You are finishing up a Sprint Challenge 1:1 review with one of your students. The student did not meet MVP for their sprint challenge, and you notice they seem to be taking the news very hard. In talking through the situation with the student, they reveal to you that they have been struggling with mental health concerns, feeling very overwhelmed, and are burnt out.

To start, I would listen to what they have to say.  I would also write down the major points of concern, so that I can discuss them with my SL (using the proper amount of discretion in disclosing sensitive information, or course).  Depending on the severity of the situation, I would either encourage them to work with me toward a solution, or begin the escalation process to get them in contact with Student Success so they can be properly taken care of.

## Case Study 4

#### You are reviewing a student's code/project, and you are fairly positive they plagiarized. 

I would reach out to my SL and explain my suspicions, and then request that they assist me in addressing the issue with the student.  I'm pretty sure policy would be to let a member of Student Success evaluate the situation, and handle the situation as they see fit.

## Case Study 5

#### You've noticed one of your students who is on the quieter side does a phenomenal job - consistently completes assignments and stretch goals, but will not participate in the group or speak-up in channels or during stand-up.

This seems like the type of thing that could be addressed during weekly one-on-ones.  I would recognize that they are doing great work, and remind them that if they speak up and contribute, everyone, even themselves, will benefit.  I would also ask if there was any way I could help, if they're suffering from shyness or anxiety, and maybe share with them some of the applicable situations in my life where I've overcome those types of problems.  I would also reach out to my fellow TL's for any strategies they might have for approaching the student.  Obviously, I wouldn't badger them continuously, and if they're just simply not comfortable speaking up in front of a group, I would try to help them, if my help was desired.  Otherwise, I might just have to let the issue lie.

## Case Study 6

#### A student comes to you, very clearly upset, and reports that they feel they were being harassed or discriminated against by another student. 

I'm pretty sure that would be an automatic escalation to the SL / Student Success to deal with.
