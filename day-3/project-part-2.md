## Activity Ideas

- Coding / Whiteboard group challenges
  > Using a site like Hackerrank or Code Wars, and possibly Codeshare for collaboration, go through some coding challenge problems and work through them as a team.  Could also start group Code Wars group, and possibly compete with other groups.
- Highlight successes & failures
  > During standup meeting on Thursday, I would like to ask each student to point out one point in the sprint where they've had a notable success, and a point where they had a really hard time with something.

## Transition Plans

When a new group member joins, I would like to have them introduce themselves during their first standup meeting, and then have the rest of the group briefly introduce themselves individually, and then get on with the meeting

If a group member leaves, I would let them wish farewell to the team if they would like to.  If they would rather not discuss their leaving with the team, or the reason for leaving not be known, I would respect those wishes.  If pressed by my students, I will explain to them that I wish to respect the individual's right to privacy.

When the whole group changes at the end of a unit, I would have to start over a little bit.  Introductions, group exercises, the lot.

## Areas of Improvement

1. Big-O Complexity
1. Sorting algorithms
1. Asking for help

I will spend quite a bit of my free / break time studying up on these topics in particular, until I am fairly confident I can speak with a reasonable amount of intelligence about them, and demonstrate that knowledge to my students.  Thankfully, I have a pretty good grasp on the concepts in Sprint 1, so I can use that time to look ahead to my problem areas.

As for asking for help, I will hold myself accountable to the 20-minute rule, be it a technical, or student issue.  I will be preaching the importance of this rule, and I need to get better at utilizing it myself.

## Areas of Confidence

I'm definitely confident in my ability to talk to my students; as a group, and individually.  My communication style tends more toward the informal, so I make efforts to be conscious of maintaining a sense of relaxed professionalism.

I'm also confident in my ability to learn more and adapt to my students' needs.  I learned a lot from being a Labs TL, most especially the need to be honest and fair with students, even if that means giving them non-passing reviews.
