The Lambda TL nternship is intended to provide TL's with leadership experience in the tech field, as well as providing a psychologically safe environment for students to learn and grow in.


# Day 1 key takeaway:

There is no one way to lead a team, except the one that works best for you and your team.  There is, however, a standard, and it's up to us to live up to it.  Your personality will determine the approach you take.


# Day 2 key takeaway:

If you don't have an answer for a student's question, help them find it.  It's ok to say "I don't know."  If something is over my head, I can ask for help from SL, or Student Success.  Follow the 20-minute rule, as I would ask my students to also do.


# Day 3 key takeaway:

Keep students accountable for careers assignments.  Stay on top of my work, and manage time effectively.  Give SL notice for needed time off.


# Day 4 key takeaway:

Use the tools at my disposal (Calendly, Polly) to effectively hold meetings (1:1's especially) that are required to assess my students' progress.  Make sure meetings are being held and attended.  When reviewing and assessing performance, be sure to uphold Lambda's standards, not my own personal standards.  Don't shoot someone in the foot trying to be their friend.
