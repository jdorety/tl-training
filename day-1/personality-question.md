## Reflection

- Is this accurate?

From a glance, it seems to be relatively accurate.

- How does this align or differ with your preferred communication style or work style? 

It only differs from my preferred style in that I've made an effort to be more outgoing in my communication style over the years.

- What are those preferred styles and how does that impact your role as a student, as a TL, as a professional?

I generally like to get a conversation going, and then get out of the way, and let it take it's course, gently nudging it back on course when things stray from the matter at hand.  As a student, I generally only speak up if I feel that what I have to say is really important, or everyone else is being silent and the instructor is struggling to get a response.  As a TL, I try to be enthusiastic, and hope it rubs off on the students, encouraging them to speak up often.

## Outline

### Values

- Honesty
- Integrity
- Consideration

### Leadership Philosophy

I prefer a more hands-off approach at first, giving everyone the benefit of the doubt, being grown adults.  If it becomes obvious that someone needs more of a guiding hand in whatever is happening, I try to provide it, or find someone who can.  TLDR: I prefer to focus on the big picture, and allow my team to handle the specifics as they see fit.

### Strengths

I bring enthusiasm and a collaborative spirit.  I'm always willing to help, and try to keep up morale.

### Growth Areas

I need to get better about confrontation with students who act inappropriately, or are having a hard time admitting they need help.  I also need to improve my willingness to ask for help before a problem grows into a major inconvenience for those around me.
