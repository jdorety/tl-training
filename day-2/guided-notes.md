# Day 2 Notes

## Setting the tone

- Students look to me, and my approach and attitude to set the tone for our group

## Building Community

- Students bring pieces of themselves to the group
- Get to know them
  - their commuication styles (internal v external)
  - quiet / shy or outgoing
- Keep student contributions balanced (withdrawing or dominating)
  - quiet folks might have great contributions, and if they don't feel comfortable sharing them, the whole group suffers

## Creating Comfortable Space

- Stick around after meeting for folks to talk off-topic if they want
- Play a game together
- Provide space to vent / air grievances
